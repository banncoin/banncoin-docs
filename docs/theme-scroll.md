# Banncoin Theme Scroll (working draft)

## Philosophy
Banncoin is layered. We don’t force a single voice; we tune several. Rollout is gradual, intentional. Each layer has a “home,” and overlaps are allowed when they add depth.

---

## Layer 1 — The Codex (Mining + Explorer)
Ritual, ancient, precise.

**Mappings**
- Block → **Seal**
- Transaction → **Transmission**
- Chain → **Archive**
- Miner reward → **Current delivered to the holder of the key**

**Variations**
- Seal 128 inscribed into the Archive. Transmission secured, reward current released.
- The Codex expands — a new Seal flows into the chain, proof etched forever.
- Archive written. The transmission holds. The flow endures.
- Seal complete. The holder of the key receives the current.
- Transmission accepted. Proof resonates. The current moves.

---

## Layer 2 — The Current (Website + Public)
Everyday language, electricity & flow.

- Banncoin is alive. Every coin is a current of energy, pulsing across the chain.
- This isn’t money that sits. It moves like voltage, like a tide.
- Currency means Current — value flows, not stagnates.
- Your energy, your current, your coin — always moving, never frozen.
- The chain hums. The current flows. Banncoin doesn’t wait.

---

## Layer 3 — Rebellion (Community / Discord)
Sovereign, anti-gatekeeper, human.

- Banks had centuries. They failed. We don’t need them anymore.
- No founder stash. No hidden tax. Just current, mined straight from proof.
- Forget the suits. This came from a room, not a boardroom.
- The banks are banned. Value belongs to people.
- They build walls around money. We release value as current.

---

## Layer 4 — The Human Seal (Story / Transparency)
Raw origin, no polish.

- This didn’t start in Silicon Valley. It started at a kitchen table with stubbornness and code.
- No degree. No pedigree. Just persistence and the belief that current belongs to people.
- A 30-year-old with no resume inscribing history, block by block.
- Banncoin is human. It’s built by us.
- From a laptop and a will, Banncoin was born. Proof that anyone can inscribe change.

---

## Structural Guideline
- **Codex** anchors Mining/Explorer.
- **Current** anchors Website/Public posts.
- **Rebellion** anchors Community.
- **Human** anchors Story/Transparency.

Overlap is fine; each layer still has a primary home.

## Horizon
We’re not a flip. Mining is live now; adoption may take years. Each Seal we inscribe becomes part of a ledger that future generations can discover and use.
